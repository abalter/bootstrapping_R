# Bootstrapping R
## Recommended Steps
It sounds to me like you will need four steps:
1. Learn how to basically communicate with R at the command line. You can do this with free, interactive, online tutorials.
2. Set up and learn how to use RStudio. This is 100% with out any room for discussion the best way to use R. There are good online guides. Videos are also helpful because you see a person navigating the UI with their mouse and stuff.
3. Learn the basics of "Tidy Data" in R and the "tidyverse". This should become a pseudo-religion for you.
  This might be covered in some free or paid online interacitive tutorials. There are also text-based online resources.
4. Tutorials to become fluent in using R, RStudio, and doing basic data/statistical analysis and graphing.

## Personal Note
R was created many decades ago on top of an even older statistical programming language called S. Due to this history, R uses "<-" as the assignment operator (you may not know what I mean yet, but you will learn). For example:

```
a <- 10
```

This is highly idiosyncratic, and will totally fuck you up if you go on to learn any other programming language, which you very likely may. 

_Every other programming language uses the much more sensible syntax_

```
a = 10
```

R will let you use this more universal assignment. R tutorials always stick to the `<-` version I think because the organizations that support R consider it "correct" for historical reasons. But really, take my advice and shun the "correct" operator in favor of the sensible and otherwise universal operator `=`.

## Free Interactive Tutorials
I would start with one of these two:

- [Quick-R:](https://www.statmethods.net/)

- [Introduction to R Online Course | DataCamp(https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

- [Applied Epi (beginner to intermediate)](https://appliedepi.org/tutorial/#our-free-self-paced-r-tutorial-series)

- [RStudio Cloud Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers)

## Semi-Interactive
This will help give you an overview of RStudio
[adventr: An Adventure in Statistics interactive tutorials](http://milton-the-cat.rocks/home/adventr.html)

## Fluency
Explore these resources (in no particular order) and find ones that fit your learning style and needs. I didn't include video resources. If you want some, ask me.
- [RStudio Cloud: Learn](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/)
- [Introduction to Data Science](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook)
- [A Gentle Introduction to Tidy Statistics in R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/)
- [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/)
- [Applied Epi (beginner to intermediate)](https://appliedepi.org/tutorial/#our-free-self-paced-r-tutorial-series)
- [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/)
  This is a bit old fashioned and doesn't emphasize tidyverse best practices. But it is so well written and well organized that it remains a great resource.
